This is an open-source project using Unity Engine, Visual Studio, Blender, Sketchup Pro,
Autodesk Maya, and Adobe Fuse, and is made just for fun to create a fun action game
that has themes reminiscent of 1980s action films and video games.

This project also utilizes Unity Cloud Build which serves as an asset server as well
as a utility to create builds faster.

Feel free to use whatever any of this code or contribute your own, as this is 
open-source and just for fun! :)
